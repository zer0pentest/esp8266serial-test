# zer0's serial terminal
theres nothing special about it. it's just spacehuhn's terminal with my name lmao. i recommend using his instead, as he designed it.
this version is open-sourced, and in my opinion makes more sense compared to his, but to each their own.

# ALSO DO NOT FORGET
you'll need to change the files so that the domains are correct, as they are just my files right now on my pc
you can change the pictures, but rename new pics image512 and image768, 512 being the icon for the tab and 768 being for the top left corner of the page. you can also change the code so that the code looks for your files and not /image512.png.
