# zer0's serial terminal
theres nothing special about it. it's just spacehuhn's terminal with my name lmao. i recommend using his instead, as he designed it.
this version is open-sourced, and in my opinion makes more sense compared to his, but to each their own.

# ALSO DO NOT FORGET
you'll need to change the files so that the domains are correct, as they are just my files right now on my pc
